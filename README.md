This app is targeted at street vendors selling fruits and vegetables door to door on their cart. Aim is to help these vendors sell their products with ease by connecting them directly to customers using this app. Vendors will be able to see the demand by customer, bargain with price online, locate other potential customers and advertise their cart and products to increase their reach.

When a customer requests an order, vendor will be able to see what they want, how much they want, at what price and how far they are in the map. If the vendor is ready to sell, they can accept the order request and navigation from their current location to customerâ€™s will start.
